# Bouncing_Ball

1. **Description of the Code:**
   - The HTML file sets up the structure of the page.
   - CSS defines the style for a class named "ball" which is applied to the ball elements.
   - JavaScript creates balls and simulates their movement and bouncing behavior within a container.

3. **How to Run the Code:**
   - Save the provided code in an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
   - Open the file with a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
   - The balls should start bouncing within the specified container.

4. **Possible Improvements:**
   - **Optimize Collision Logic:** Consider using more accurate collision detection algorithms to handle collisions more realistically.
   - **Responsive Design:** Make the simulation responsive by adjusting sizes and positions relative to the container dimensions.
   - **User Interaction:** Allow users to control the simulation or add controls to change parameters like gravity, ball count, etc.
